# athena-components

The idea behind this repository is to create a set of components to use when creating articles like Snowfall or Climbin Everest. In a final iteration, I hope to use the [Polymer Designer](https://polymer-designer.appspot.com/) as a visual editor for the components we choose to make available.

From a technical stand point. Web Components and the Polymer Project in particular provide a way to compose larger applications from base components and to provide flexible and powerful APIs to make our applications look great and feel powerful.

What attracted me to Polymer when I first started working with the technology in 2013 was that it's flexible but still enforces discipline and pushes good coding conventions into your project. It also hides details and complexity of doing things correctly
